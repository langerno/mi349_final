                <p>
                    My name is Nolan Langer. I’m a Senior at Michigan State University studying Computer Science. Most of my time is spent working and in school, but outside of school and work I like to cook, play video games, play music, and camp. 
                    There is plenty I could tell, but I feel I should stick to what is most relevant, which is school and work. 
                </p>

                For a long time I struggled with school due to trouble at home, but once I reached high school I realized I needed to change. My mom was the only working parent in my family because my dad was on disability and worked hard to 
                make sure that we had a stable life at home. Using her as inspiration for work ethic and my dad as inspiration for perseverance, I worked hard to go from barely even attending school to being an almost straight-A student with a 
                >4.0 GPA in my junior and senior years of high school. This has bled into my college career as well, I’ve worked hard to do well and hold a 3.9 GPA currently which I hope to maintain until my graduation in December 2023. 
                My interest in Computer Science stems from my senior year of high school, where I had been taking classes at the local community college with one of my friends to get credit and he showed me how to program my calculator to do simple 
                calculations for me in the class we took together. The logic just seemed to click in my head and, even though I didn’t understand it a whole lot at the time, I wanted to spend so much time just sitting and figuring out how to do more 
                and more on the calculator.

                When I first enrolled at MSU I came in as a Mechanical Engineering major but I wasn’t fully satisfied with where I saw myself in the future and I also noticed just how much I would get lost in the projects for our Intro to Programming class 
                and even how much I enjoyed the pure math classes I took. Both of these interests are what led me to switch to Computer Science where I saw a wonderful balance of logic, math, and creation. On top of this I’ve decided to take classes at MSU 
                on the User Research and User Experience design process because I wanted to learn more about understanding people’s needs and interests through studies and statistics as well as building products for them that are easy to use and accessible 
                to all types of people. I’ve learned a huge amount from MSU and have been a part of the MSU AI Club where I’ve fed an interest in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I have been working at Jackson National Life in their IT Career Development 
                Program where I’ve worked with their Cloud Engineering team to develop Infrastructure as Code using Terraform in Microsoft Azure, the Software Delivery team where I developed enterprise applications for Jackson in an AGILE style environment, 
                and the Information Security team where I learned the fundamentals of of Information Security for large corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to build a strong career in the tech industry and use my knowledge and experience to help others grow as individuals and to help the world become a better place.
